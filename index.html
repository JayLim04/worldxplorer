          the west by the Sea of Japan, while extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea,
          Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852
          islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu (the
          "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by

        <a>Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country and city-state in maritime
          Southeast Asia.
          It lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator,
          off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west,
          the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north.
          The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying
          islet,
          the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land
          reclamation projects.
          It has the third highest population density in the world.
          With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic
          groups within the nation,
          Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.
          English is the lingua franca and numerous public services are available only in English. Multiracialism is
          enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and
          politics.</a>
